The first suggestion of using Moffat profile was made in 1969 by A. F. J. Moffat in [this paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?bibcode=1969A%26A.....3..455M&db_key=AST) (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol. 3, p. 455 (1969)). \n",

FWHM is defined as the distance between the two points which have the value $\\frac{1}{2} f_{\\rm max}$. FWHM is also used for Lorenzian profile, which has infinite standard deviation (the second centered moment diverges, so the standard deviation is not defined, but FWHM can). The profiles of two psfs and their FWHMs are described below:"

It actually is rarely the case. We encounter elliptical, or even irregularly shaped isophotes. In such cases, you may make elliptical model rotated by certain angle, or simulate the seeing. Those fitting or simulation can be done using Astropy if necessary. Usually we believe the tracking is perfect, and use circular aperture. \n",
